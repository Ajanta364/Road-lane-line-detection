# Road-lane-line-detection
This project is a Road Lane Line Detection System using Python and OpenCV. It processes images and videos to detect and highlight road lanes using computer vision techniques.

Features:
Lane Detection in Images and Videos: Detects lanes in both images and video frames.
Edge Detection: Uses Canny edge detection to identify edges.
Line Filtering: Filters detected lines based on slope and length.
Line Averaging: Averages multiple line segments to create single lane lines.
Temporal Consistency: Reduces flickering in video lane detection.
Requirements:
Python 3.x
OpenCV
NumPy
